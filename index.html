  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p><strong>Nadtochiy Photography</strong> is a husband-and-wife team — Alexandra and Vladimir Nadtochiy — specializing in fine art and documentary photography for weddings, engagements, families, and cinematic videography. Since 2008, we have captured over 500 weddings and nearly 1,000 love stories, working across Canada, Europe, and beyond.</p>

  <p>After 11 years living and working in Montenegro, we now call Toronto home. Our mission is to document real emotions with a timeless aesthetic — natural light, elegant tones, and a sense of calm storytelling. Every frame we create aims to preserve the beauty and sincerity of human connection.</p>

  <p>We believe that photography is not just about perfect poses but about <em>truth</em> — the quiet smiles, fleeting gestures, and unspoken warmth that make every story unique. Whether it’s a wedding in downtown Toronto, a lakeside engagement, or a Sunday morning with your family, our goal is always the same: to tell your story honestly and beautifully.</p>

  <h2>Wedding Photography</h2>
  <p>Our approach to <a href="https://nadtochiy.com/wedding-galleries">wedding photography in Toronto</a> is cinematic and emotional. We document the day naturally — from quiet morning preparations to the energy of the dance floor. With more than 15 years of experience, we’ve developed a signature blend of documentary storytelling and fine art composition.</p>

  <p>We love shooting in locations that feel personal — maybe where you first met, a park where you walk together, or a scenic view that represents your love. Our <a href="https://nadtochiy.com/engagement-galleries">engagement galleries</a> showcase couples who wanted something meaningful and timeless.</p>

  <h2>Family Photography</h2>
  <p>Our <a href="https://nadtochiy.com/family-gallery">family photography</a> is about genuine emotion, not posing. We photograph your family as you are — laughing, hugging, playing, connecting. Whether it’s at home, in a Toronto park, or by the lake, these sessions tell the story of love across generations.</p>
